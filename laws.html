      <h1>Laws of the North</h1>

      <p>
        The North is a land of harsh seasons and harsh justice. These laws reflect the traditions,
        honor, and survivalist values passed down by the kings and lords of Winterfell for generations.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Obedience to the Crown</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The word of the King in the North is law. All bannermen and subjects owe their loyalty and obedience.</li>
        <li>Decrees issued by the Winter Court shall carry the same authority as royal edicts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>II. Trial and Justice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All freefolk have the right to a trial, either by combat or before a sitting judge of the North.</li>
        <li>Execution is carried out by the hand of the one who passes the sentence, in the old way.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>III. Treason and Oathbreaking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Betrayal of the Crown, Court, or one's liege is punishable by death, exile, or forfeiture of lands.</li>
        <li>False banners and desertion in war are considered capital offenses.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>IV. Rights of Blood and Land</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Heirs inherit by blood, and lands remain with rightful Northern houses unless taken by legal claim or conquest recognized by the Crown.</li>
        <li>The Crown may redistribute lands in response to treason, rebellion, or bloodline extinction.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>V. The Faith of the North</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The worship of the Old Gods is held in highest esteem. Other faiths may be practiced, so long as they do not defy the laws or incite unrest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>VI. The King's Peace</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Private war and feuding between houses is forbidden without royal sanction. The King's Peace must be honored at all times unless lifted by decree.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>VII. The Law of Hospitality</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Guest right is sacred. The violation of guest right—harming a guest or host after bread and salt—is considered a grave crime against the gods and realm.</li>
      </ul>
